# Automatic Light Using a Photoresistor

For this project, I used a photoresistor to control an LED automatically. I initially setup a basic photoresistor circuit in order to measure the voltage recorded by the photoresistor when the lights in my room were on, and once with the lamp turned on. I used these values to set up `if` clauses that would handle my program. This was then used to blink the LED on and off accordingly. 

## Key Takeaways

- Using a photoresistor in a circuit 
    - Something fascinating was that as the light intensity increased, the resistance decreased, causing the current to increase, and thereby causing the voltage recorded using the `analogRead()` function to also increase.
- Basic troubleshooting techniques
