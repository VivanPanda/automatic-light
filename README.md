# Automatic Light Using a Photoresistor

For this project, I used a photoresistor to control an LED automatically. I measured the voltage recorded by the photoresistor with and without a lamp turned on and used this to control a red LED. 

## Key Takeaways

- Using a photoresistor in a circuit 
    - Something fascinating was that as the light intensity increased, the resistance decreased, causing the current to increase, and thereby causing the voltage recorded using the `analogRead()` function to also increase.
